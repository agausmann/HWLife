## Future improvements

- Current connectors are bulky, size could be reduced significantly if I use
more low-profile ones.

- Connector pinouts are rotationally symmetric, so board orientation doesn't matter. However, this is limited by having gendered connectors. Hermaphroditic connectors would be cool but more expensive...
